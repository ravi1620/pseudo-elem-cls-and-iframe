        sports, the captain is usually experienced and has good communication
        skills and is likely to be one of the most regular members of the team,
        as the captain is responsible for the team selection. Before the
        starting of the game in cricket, the captains toss which decides which
        team will bat first. <mark>During the match the captain decides the team's
        batting order, who will bowl each over, and where each fielder will be
